# CAN_Sniffer

CAN Bus sniffer developed for STM32F429 platform using the STM32F429 Discovery board. This connects to a car's dashboard CAN bus via a NXP TJA1050 transceiver over the OBD2 protocol.

The OBD2 protocol is an industry-wide standard to provide access to a vehicle's self-diagnostic data via the CAN bus. The CAN Sniffer provides a GUI displaying real-time statistics decoded from the OBD2 protocol.

CAN Sniffer has been tested with a Ford Mondeo and Audi A3.
